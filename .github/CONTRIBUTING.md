# Introduction

You want to contribute to Algorithms and Data Structures? Cool! Feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know what and how to work on this repository. If you get into a problem, make an issue, and we'll respond!

## Why the Guidelines

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the everyone managing and contributing to this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Contribution Guidelines

This is repository is aimed towards being a go to section for all new students to reference code from. Help us do that by adding algorithms and Data Structure implementations in the Languages you love to use!

## Ground Rules

**With great code, comes great responsibilities!**

These are some general rules so everyone can contribute with no conflicts of any kind, either in code, or between contributors!

- :warning:**Fork the repo make a new branch name as your username and do changes else it will not be accepted.**
- :warning:**Don't update [MAIN README](../README.md) in case of new language addition**, it would be updated once your pull request is accepted.
- :warning:**Don't update and add name in [CONTRIBUTORS](../CONTRIBUTORS.md)** file it would be added if your pull request is accepted ASAP.
- :warning:For **new Issue**, make sure that you add in a **good level detail** for the issue you find in the code and also add path to the bug file.

### New Code Addition Rules

**Developers:** *Its not a bug its a feature* :smile: **Programmers:** *Its not a feature its LOGICAL ERROR* :sunglasses:

- Ensure that the code you write contains **proper comments and is formatted as the general convention** of the language
  - C code must adhere to [GNU Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html)
  - C++ code must adhere to [Google Coding Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
  - Java Code must adhere to [Google Coding Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
  - Javascript code must adhere to [JSLint Quality](http://jslint.com)
  - Python code must serve to [PEP8 convention](http://pep8online.com/)
  - Kotlin Code must adhere to [Official Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html)

- Maintain same directory structure as recommended in [MAIN README](../README.md).
- Make sure your code has **Proper Identation** so that it would be easy for fellow programmers to read your code.
- **Add new language you love** except already present but its **mandatory for you to add a Algorithm or a Data Structure code of new language**.
- Each code snippet should contain some testing inputs and output to make sure that your code works well and specify where it fails.

### Want to be Debugger

Find bugs in our code and create [issue](https://github.com/GauravWalia19/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/issues).

### BUG FIXING

See [bugs issues](https://github.com/GauravWalia19/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/issues) fix bugs and create [pull request](https://github.com/GauravWalia19/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/pulls) it will be accepted in 24 hours ASAP.

### Add new DOCS

Hola guys do you love to write documentation so following instructions are for you.

- Maintain same heading structure for the docs as recommended in [MAIN README](../README.md).
- Don't update [online wiki](https://github.com/GauravWalia19/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/wiki/wiki) or [wiki file](../docs/wiki.md).
- Add name same as algorithm or data structure name you are adding.
- DOCS should be added in docs directory only.
