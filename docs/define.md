# [:arrow_left:](../README.md) DEFINATIONS

## TIME COMPLEXITY

Time Complexity tell about **how much time an algorithm will take to solve the problem**.

## SPACE COMPLEXITY

Space Complexity tells about **how much memory an algorithm will take to solve the problem**.

## Big O Notation

Big O Notation is a way of expressing the complexity related to number of items that an algorthm will deal with. It will tell for how many inputs the algorithm will support. It is represented by O().
