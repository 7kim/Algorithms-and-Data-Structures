# [:arrow_left:](../README.md) DEFINATIONS

## :rocket: Algorithms

Algorithms are the series of steps which have no ambiguity that we follow to solve some problem.

## :rocket: Data Structures

Data Structures are the Structures formed by Data Types which makes our code efficient and we can use data in a systematic way. For example Stacks,Queues,Lists,arrays,etc.There are two types of Data Structures:

### Linear Data Structures

Data Structures in which data is organised linear and in sequential order. For example Arrays,Queues,etc.

### Non Linear Data Structures

Data Structures in which data is organised in non linear and in non-sequenstial order. For example Trees,Graphs,etc.

## :rocket: TIME COMPLEXITY

Time Complexity tell about **how much time an algorithm will take to solve the problem**.

## :rocket: SPACE COMPLEXITY

Space Complexity tells about **how much memory an algorithm will take to solve the problem**.

## :rocket: Big O Notation

Big O Notation is a way of expressing the complexity related to number of items that an algorthm will deal with. It will tell for how many inputs the algorithm will support. It is represented by O().
