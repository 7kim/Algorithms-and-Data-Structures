# [:arrow_left:](../README.md) DEFINATIONS

## :rocket: Algorithms

Algorithms are the series of steps which have no ambiguity that we follow to solve some problem.

## :rocket: Data Structures

Data Structures are the Structures formed by Data Types which makes our code efficient and we can use data in a systematic way. For example Stacks,Queues,Lists,arrays,etc.There are two types of Data Structures:

### Linear Data Structures

Data Structures in which data is organised linear and in sequential order. For example

* Arrays,
* Lists,
* Queues,etc.

### Non Linear Data Structures

Data Structures in which data is organised in non linear and in non-sequenstial order. For example

* Trees,
* Graphs,etc.

## :rocket: Big O Notation

* Big O Notation is a way of expressing the complexity related to number of items that an algorthm will deal with.
* It will tell for how many inputs the algorithm will support.
* It is represented by **O()**.
* It will tell us the **Worst Case (Maximum time to solve the problem)** of the Algorithm.
* Theoritically
